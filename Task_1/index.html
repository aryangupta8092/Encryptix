According to the latest figures, the literacy rate in India is only <strong>74%</strong>. This means that more than one quarter of the population is still illiterate. Illiteracy is a state in which someone is unable to read and write. In other words, it can also be defined as a lack of education. It constitutes the backbone of development in a progressing country like India. In our country, the adult literacy rate is measured for people aged above 15 years, and the rate of youth literacy is measured for people aged between 15-24 years.
