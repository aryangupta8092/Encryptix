                <h4>Education: Every child deserves access to quality education!</h4>
                <p>The problem of illiteracy in India is a matter of great concern. Despite the fact that the country has made great strides in education, the literacy rate is still very low. According to the latest figures, the literacy rate in India is only 74%.
                    This means that more than one quarter of the population is still illiterate. Illiteracy is a state in which someone is unable to read and write. In other words, it can also be defined as a lack of education. It constitutes the backbone of development in a progressing country like India. In our country, the adult literacy rate is measured for people aged above 15 years, and the rate of youth literacy is measured for people aged between 15-24 years.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Hamari Pahchan</b> began to work on the cause of education for the underprivileged with informal classes and slowly moved to more organized and regular classes that also include themes around the overall development of a child's cognitive and behavioral aspects.
