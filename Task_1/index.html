                    The problem of illiteracy in India is a matter of great concern. Despite the fact that the country has made great strides in education, the literacy rate is still very low. According to the latest figures, the literacy rate in India is only 74%.
                    This means that more than one quarter of the population is still illiterate. Illiteracy is a state in which someone is unable to read and write. In other words, it can also be defined as a lack of education. It constitutes the backbone of development in a progressing country like India. In our country, the adult literacy rate is measured for people aged above 15 years, and the rate of youth literacy is measured for people aged between 15-24 years.

                    Elder abuse is a serious problem that affects many older adults in India. It can take many forms, including physical, emotional, financial, and sexual abuse. Elderly people who are abused may be afraid to speak out or seek help, and as a result, the abuse may go unnoticed and continue for a long time. To combat this issue, it is essential to raise awareness of elder abuse and provide support to victims. This includes developing laws and policies to protect the elderly from abuse, providing education and training for caregivers and healthcare professionals, and creating safe spaces where elderly people can report abuse without fear of retaliation.
                    <br/>
                    Moreover, social isolation and loneliness are also significant issues affecting the elderly population in India. Many elderly people live alone or with family members who are too busy to provide them with social interaction and companionship. This can lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues.<br/>
                    <b>Hamari Pahchan has come up with an initiative for our elderly; we plan to distribute comfort kits to those in need:</b><br/>
                    1 Kit for 1 elderly person = Rs.800/- for 3 months.<br/>
                    1 Kit for 1 person for a year = Rs. 3120/- approx. <br/>
                    Comfort Kit for the elderly includes a hot water bag, age-appropriate medicines, thermometer, blankets (according to season), energy drinks like Glucon D and a mosquito repellant spray.<br/>
